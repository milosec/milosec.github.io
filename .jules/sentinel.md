## 2026-01-16 - Static Site Security & API Key Exposure
**Vulnerability:** Hardcoded Google Maps API Key in client-side HTML and lack of security headers.
**Learning:** Static sites (like Mobirise exports) often lack backend capabilities to hide secrets or set HTTP headers. API keys for client-side services (Maps) are inevitably exposed.
**Prevention:** Mitigate by restricting API keys in the provider's console (Referrer restrictions). Enhance security posture by adding CSP and Referrer-Policy via meta tags to limit the impact of potential XSS, even if no backend exists.

## 2026-01-16 - Reverse Tabnabbing in Generated Code
**Vulnerability:** External links with `target="_blank"` generated by Mobirise lacked `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
**Learning:** CMS or site builders may default to insecure link attributes. `project.mobirise` contains HTML fragments in JSON strings, requiring specialized parsing to fix.
**Prevention:** Systematically scan generated HTML for `target="_blank"` and enforce `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
