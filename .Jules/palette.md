## 2024-05-23 - Accessibility in Auto-Generated Static Sites
**Learning:** Tools like Mobirise generate visually appealing sites but often neglect basic accessibility, populating `alt` attributes with "Mobirise Website Builder" and leaving icon-only links without `aria-label`.
**Action:** When working with generated code, first audit all images and interactive elements. Replace default "builder spam" `alt` text with descriptive text or empty strings for decorative elements, and ensure all icon-only buttons/links have `aria-label` or screen reader only text.
